Your checked baggage allowance is based on the weight or piece concept, depending on your final destination.&nbsp;</p><hr style="clear: both"><h2 id="baggagetips">Baggage tips</h2><p>Here are some tips on how you can ensure that your checked baggage arrives safely at your destination:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>While Packing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consider purchasing a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/plan-travel/privileges/travel-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travel insurance</a> that covers the loss, delay or damage of baggage and personal belongings before you embark on your trip.</li>
<li>Consider including a tracking device in your baggage.</li>
<li>Pack within your baggage allowance. Charges will be levied for checked baggage that exceeds your free baggage allowance.</li>
<li>Ensure your bags are in good condition, to ensure that the handling is smooth and your belongings remain safe.</li>
<li>Attach a distinctive feature (for example, using ribbons or stickers) to allow you to easily identify your baggage.</li>
<li>Do not include any medication, valuable items or important documents, such as laptops, jewellery, cash, visas, certificates, etc., in your checked baggage.</li>
<li>Do not carry fragile and perishable items in your checked baggage. If you're carrying food items in your checked baggage, the same considerations apply as that for your <a href="https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/us/travel-info/baggage/cabin-baggage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cabin baggage</a>.</li>
<li>Attach your contact information inside and outside your checked baggage with your full name, permanent residential address, email and contact number.</li>
<li>Remove all baggage tags and labels from previous flights from your checked baggage.</li>
<li>Ensure that all battery-operated devices in the checked baggage are completely switched off (not in sleep or hibernation mode), protected from damage, and prevented from unintentional activation. For more information on general restrictions in your cabin and checked baggage, click <a href="https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/travel-info/baggage/baggage-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>At the Airport</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take pictures of your baggage prior to checking them in.</li>
<li>Check in your baggage before the check-in counter closes. Please click <a href="http://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/travel-info/check-in/counter-checkin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for the check-in counter closure timings.</li>
<li>Do not check in any baggage which has contents you are not fully aware of.</li>
<li>Inform our check-in staff if there are any restricted items or dangerous goods in your checked baggage, such as lithium ion batteries and power banks. Please click <a href="http://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/travel-info/baggage/baggage-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for a list of restricted items and dangerous goods. Do clarify with check-in staff if you are unsure if an item in your checked baggage is a restricted item.</li>
<li>Inform the check-in staff of any protruding parts or existing damage to your baggage during check-in.</li>
<li>Inform the check-in staff of any fragile items in your baggage during check-in.</li>
<li>Retain the checked baggage receipt given to you by the check-in agent even after arriving at your destination.</li>
<li>Check that the passenger name, number of baggage checked in and the destination shown on the checked baggage receipt are correct.</li>
<li>Lock your checked baggage. For baggage checked in for flights departing to/from the USA, please use only TSA approved locks as non-TSA approved locks will be pried open should your checked baggage be subject to inspection by TSA.</li>
<li>Ensure all loose and protruding parts, such as straps and handles, are securely fastened to your checked baggage.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Upon Arrival</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Collect all checked baggage before leaving the arrival hall.</li>
<li>Check the baggage tag upon collecting your baggage to confirm ownership before leaving the arrival hall.</li>
<li>In the unlikely event that your baggage is delayed or arrives damaged, approach the Lost &amp; Found Office assistance, or lodge a report <a href="https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/travel-info/baggage/delayed-or-damaged-baggage/">here</a>.</li>

<p>An infant is entitled to one piece of checked baggage that is up to 23kg or 32kg, depending on your class of travel. If you are travelling with an infant, you are also allowed to check in one item from each of the category below</p>

<p>For travel originating or travel ending in Canada or in the United States, if the first carrier on your booking is not Singapore Airlines, that carrier’s baggage policy may apply for the whole itinerary on a single ticket or conjunction tickets.</p>
<br>
<p>Depending on where your travel begins or ends in Canada or in the United States, different baggage rules may apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your first flight originates on Singapore Airlines from LAX, SFO, IAH, JFK or on a US Airways flight with an SQ flight number, then Singapore Airlines’ baggage policy will apply to your entire itinerary.</li>
<li>If your first flight originates from any other US city or the first flight does not have an SQ flight number, the baggage policy of the first carrier may apply to the whole itinerary (per US Department of Transportation rules and if the itinerary is on a single ticket or conjunction tickets).</li>
<li>If your destination is a US city and first flight does not have an SQ flight number, the baggage policy of the first carrier may apply to the whole itinerary (per US Department of Transportation rules and if the itinerary is on a single ticket or conjunction tickets).</li>
<li>If another airline’s baggage policy applies to your booking (applicable to itineraries on a single ticket or on conjunction tickets), an additional baggage allowance can only be purchased from that airline. Please refer to the relevant websites of our partner airlines to review their specific rules.</li>
</ul>
<div id="_mcePaste" class="mcePaste">&nbsp;</div><hr style="clear: both"><h2 id="weight-limitation">Weight limitation</h2><p>In line with local Occupational Health and Safety rules, each of your checked baggage cannot exceed 32kg. Should your baggage exceed 32kg, the items may have to be re-packed or sent as cargo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your itinerary is booked on separate tickets, the baggage allowance printed on each ticket will apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For itineraries booked on a single ticket, refer to the information below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two terms to you need to know when flying multiple airlines:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘Marketing Carrier’ refers to the airline that sells the ticket for a flight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘Most Significant Marketing Carrier’ is the airline whose code can be found on the ticket for the longest geographical or most significant stretch of the journey.</p>
<p><br>To find out more on baggage allowance privileges on other airlines' flights as a PPS Club or KrisFlyer Elite Gold member, please refer to <a href="https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/ppsclub-krisflyer/ppsclub/the-ppsclub/privileges/">Privileges of PPS Club</a> or <a href="https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/ppsclub-krisflyer/krisflyer/krisflyer-elite-gold/benefits/">Benefits of KrisFlyer Elite Gold</a>.<br><br></p>
<h4>When flying to and from Canada or the USA</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first marketing carrier will decide the baggage policies for the entire journey. The first marketing carrier may choose to apply the baggage policies of the Most Significant Marketing Carrier or apply its own baggage policies for the journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, Airline X is the first marketing carrier on this journey:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington (Airline X) -&gt; San Francisco (SQ) -&gt; Hong Kong</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore Airlines (SQ), on the other hand, is the most significant marketing carrier on this journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the first marketing carrier, Airline X gets to decide whether their or Singapore Airlines’ baggage allowance applies to the whole journey.</p>
<p><br>If you have any doubts, please refer to the applicable free baggage allowance indicated on your ticket for each sector of your flight.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<h4>When flying to and from any other part of the world</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case, the baggage allowance of the most significant marketing carrier applies. On journeys that include a stopover, the most significant marketing carrier may change after the stopover point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>There are two most significant marketing carriers on this journey:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore (SG) -&gt; Bangkok (stopover; Airline A) -&gt; Copenhagen (no stopover; Airline B) -&gt; Stockholm</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From Singapore to Bangkok, Singapore Airlines is the most significant marketing carrier. However, from Bangkok to Stockholm, Airline A travels the greatest geographical distance and is the most significant marketing carrier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The baggage allowance for Singapore Airlines applies on the flight from Singapore to Bangkok, while the baggage allowance for Airline A applies on the flights from Bangkok to Stockholm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>Singapore Airlines is the most significant marketing carrier on this journey, as it doesn’t include a stopover:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canberra (Airline P) -&gt; Brisbane (no stopover; Airline Q) -&gt; Singapore (no stopover; SQ) -&gt; London</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The baggage allowance for Singapore Airlines applies throughout the journey from Canberra to London.</p>

<p>For the safety, comfort and convenience of everyone on board, it is important for us to ensure that the overhead compartments are not excessively full and the cabin remains clutter-free.</p>
<br>
<p>If your cabin baggage exceeds the limits, it will be collected and stored in the aircraft cargo compartment. You may also have to pay for <a href="/en_UK/us/travel-info/baggage/additional-baggage-charges/">additional baggage charges</a> if the combined weight or pieces of baggage exceeds your free baggage allowance. Exception applies for baby strollers. We reserve the right to determine if any baggage or item(s) in your baggage is not permitted in the cabin or on board our flight.</p><hr style="clear: both"><h2 id="itemsonboard">Additional items allowed on board</h2><p>You may carry ONE of these items with you on our flights, free of charge, in addition to your cabin baggage allowance (subject to country restrictions, where applicable):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ladies’ handbag*</li>
<li>Camera / Camera bag*</li>
<li>Document bag*</li>

<li>A walking stick, a pair of crutches and/or other prosthetic devices, if you are dependent on them</li>
<li>A small amount of duty free goods (where permitted)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>* The maximum dimensions for these bags are 40x30x10cm each. If your item exceeds the total dimension of 80cm (the length, width and height combined), it will be counted as part of your standard cabin baggage allowance. You will then be required to check in either your cabin bag or the additional item.</p><hr style="clear: both"><h2 id="cabinbaggagecheck">Cabin baggage checks</h2><p>We’ll carry out checks on our flights at check-in and prior to boarding. At check-in, cabin baggage that exceeds the allowed limits must be checked in. Prior to boarding, cabin baggage that exceeds the allowed limits will be collected and stored in the aircraft cargo compartment. Excess baggage charge may be added if the combined weight or pieces with the bags already checked in exceeds your checked baggage allowance.</p>
<br>
<p>For faster security checks and to ensure your safety as well as that of our cabin crew, please observe the guidelines on the weight and size of carry-on luggage.&nbsp;This will minimise the likelihood of injuries, which could be caused by luggage falling from the overhead compartments due to excess stowage. Any cabin baggage that exceeds the stipulated allowances will have to be checked in.&nbsp;This will also help ensure the aircraft cabin remains clutter-free, so other passengers and the crew can move around easily.</p>
<br>
<p>For the safety and comfort of both you and your fellow passengers, Singapore Airlines will retain the sole discretion to decide whether any item of your baggage will be permitted in the cabin or must be carried as checked baggage.</p><hr style="clear: both"><h2 id="bringfood">Food items</h2><p>Some countries have strict restrictions on the food items you can or cannot carry. If you wish to carry food items with you, we advise you to check with the relevant authorities before you fly.</p>

Hence, we recommend that you remove all items you will need on board, before checking in your baggage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TSA advises passengers to leave their baggage <strong>unlocked</strong> or use a TSA accepted and recognised lock to facilitate the search process. TSA will not be liable for any damage caused to locked bags if they are opened for screening. For bags opened during screening, the screeners will close it with a tamper-evident seal and insert a notice in your bag to inform you that the bag has been opened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As this procedure is governed by US legislation and beyond the control of the airline, we regret that we cannot be held liable for damage or loss of items from your baggage.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are travelling from airports that serve as the last points of departure to the United States, the TSA may require passengers to undergo enhanced security measures. Such checks may include the inspection of your Personal Electronic Devices (PEDs) prior to carrying them onboard.</p>

<ol style="padding-left: 55px;" type="a">
<li>The pilot-in-command determines that there is a safety or security risk to deplaning passengers, such as a weather event or an air traffic control or government directive.</li>
<li>Air traffic control advises that returning to the gate, or allowing customers to deplane at a location other than the gate, would significantly disrupt airport operations.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Customers can be assured that Singapore Airlines:
<ul class="noindent" style="padding-left: 55px; list-style-type: disc;">

<li>has sufficient resources to implement the plan; and</li>
<li>has coordinated with airport authorities, US Custom and Border Patrol and US Transportation Security Administration personnel at each US airport the carrier serves, as well as its regular diversion US airports, to achieve disembarking passengers by 4 hours into a tarmac delay.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="delaycontingencyplanchina">For flights departing from airports in China</h2><p>We’re committed to implementing the appropriate contingency plans when experiencing a flight departure delay at an airport in China.</p>

Singapore Airlines will not be liable to carry out these mitigating efforts in cases where the flight cancellations, delays and misconnections arise due to factors beyond the airline’s control, for example, acts of God, acts of war, terrorism etc., but will do so on a best effort basis.</li>
<li>Singapore Airlines will deploy staff to address feedback in Mandarin and English. Passengers can <a href="https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/contact-us/">contact Singapore Airlines</a>, or send their feedback or enquiry through our website.</li>
