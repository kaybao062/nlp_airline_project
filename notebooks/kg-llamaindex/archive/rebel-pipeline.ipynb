We barely made it and were offered no help. The airline was well aware that the flight was late and that people making connections would be having issues.

My recent encounter with American Airlines has left me utterly disappointed and frustrated. From start to finish, the experience was marred by a complete lack of care and professionalism, particularly exemplified by staff at the counter, whose rudeness was unparalleled. First and foremost, our flight was delayed not just once or twice, but a staggering five times. This not only disrupted my plans but also caused me to miss a crucial business meeting that I had traveled for. Despite explaining the urgency of my situation to the staff, he seemed indifferent and unapologetic, displaying a shocking level of disregard for customer concerns. To add insult to injury, the ordeal didn't end there. Due to the repeated delays, I inevitably missed my return flight as well. In what should have been a straightforward journey, American Airlines managed to turn it into a logistical nightmare. What truly astounds me is the blatant apathy displayed by American Airlines towards their customers. Despite multiple instances of inconvenience and dissatisfaction, there was no semblance of empathy or effort to rectify the situation. It's disheartening to see a company prioritize profits over the well-being and satisfaction of its patrons. In conclusion, my advice to anyone considering American Airlines is simple: stay away. The combination of abysmal customer service, frequent delays, and a lack of accountability make for an experience that is best avoided at all costs. Until significant improvements are made, I will be taking my business elsewhere, and I strongly urge others to do the same.\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We started off pretty good we travel with a service dog so they were very nice about it. From our departure we were delayed so knowing this the airline knew we weren’t going to make it for the connection flight either way they let us depart. Once in Miami it took us awhile to get off the plane. Most of us were rushing because we had to take another plane. It didn’t matter because there was a never ending line to go through passport control same with the check point so we were missing the connection flights regardless. I don’t understand why American Airlines makes you get your luggage at your arrival in Miami and then makes you drop up right before the check point I never had to do such thing with other airlines this was such a waste of time knowing the time frame we had for the connection was very short so thanks AA for making things more complicated. So after missing our flight we ended up rebooking. They didn’t have anything to offer because they had tons of people waiting to be reseat from different flights so seems like the airline have a problem with schedules because it was more than one flight with the same issue. We ended up on a standby list hoping to get out of the airport the next day by 7 am. They didn’t offer a hotel room or food because according to them this wasn’t the airline’s fault it was an “air traffic issue” they also said it was because the bad weather up north which wasn’t true. After all the next day at 7 am we showed up at the counter hoping to find a seat in this airplane we found out we were 45 people waiting to be reseated. We didn’t get a seat in that flight so we had to talk to an agent and put us first on the next waiting list. We finally got to the 8 am JFK flight and they finally let us depart after such a long day of traveling.

My husband and I assumed they had none left and just accepted, however we heard the next side being given the option of chicken or pasta. My husband very kindly asked Raul why we were not given a choice. His response, in an extremely blunt tone “you don’t get a choice” which completely stunned us. My husband then, again politely mentioned about the next row and he then went uncaringly ‘well we get a number for each side’ We understand this however the attitude was unnecessary and felt like a completely power move.

I arrived at the Kona airport 2 hrs prior to my flight and stood in a very long line at the ticketing counter where one employee was working. I had already purchased my checked bag through the app so I thought about going to the counter and asking for my baggage tag but did not want to be disrespectful of all of the people in front of me, so I stood in the long line. By the time I got up to the counter, it was about 40 minutes to my flight, and I was denied the ability to check my bag. I assured the attendant that I was there in plenty of time, but that the line was long, and even asked that they check cameras to verify. I was told that he is not going to put my luggage onto this flight regardless of me being here on time because I didn’t make it to the counter in time. His only resolution was to rebook on a later flight and stated that I would have to buy a whole new ticket to even get on it. When I protested, the agent rolled his eyes, smirked, slammed my ID on the counter face down, and walked away while I was still speaking. I was with two friends and we were in utter shock of the disrespect displayed by the employee. I asked for a manager, but she refused to come over. I needed to make this flight so I could get home for work, so I had to leave my suitcase on HI. These agents laughed at me and told me “good luck”. Once I arrived home, I called American Airlines to report this, but was told by the representative and the supervisor to call American Airlines cargo to pay and have my suitcase shipped, because they would do nothing about this. Even though I protested because I thought this was outrageous, I called American Airlines cargo. AA Cargo stated “I don’t know why representatives continue to send customers to us… we will only work with businesses, not passengers for their personal luggage. I got off the phone with them and wondered why “the right hand doesn’t know what the left-hand is doing“ at American Airlines, and still sat with no resolve of getting my luggage from Hawaii to Phoenix. My only option was to email a complaint because American Airlines will not even take complaints by phone and attempt to help customers. I am an American Airlines advantage member and this represents American Airlines and Kona airport terribly as being absolutely no help and disrespectful to their patrons. And I am now back home without any of my belongings to no fault of my own with no resolution to this horrific experience offered by American Airlines except their own cargo company (that actually is not an option), and a suggestion to FedEx my 50 pound suitcase for nearly $400.00. Shame on you, American Airlines, for causing this issue in the first place, not accommodating a loyal customer, allowing disrespect to happen in multiple avenues of your company, blaming me for standing in your long line for too long, and offering no help or resolution to someone who is now out all of their personal belongings all because you did not schedule enough employees at the ticketing counter to work through long lines, and allowed blatant, disrespect, and disregard for customers.

However, my recent encounter at the airport on March 1st has left a blemish on what I\\'ve always considered a reliable choice for air travel. American Airlines has seemingly adopted a new policy where their staff are directed not to assist customers directly unless through the use of the airline\\'s mobile app. This approach felt incredibly impersonal and contrary to the warm service I\\'ve come to expect. Observing staff members choosing to wear headphones and dismiss passenger inquiries directly contradicts the essence of customer service. This shift towards a more detached interaction is not only disappointing but signals a worrying trend in their service philosophy. Moreover, my dismay was further compounded when reviewing the safety brochures provided onboard. It appears American Airlines has taken to only labeling their aircraft as \"737,\" omitting any mention of it being a Boeing or the specific variant number. This choice strikes me as a deliberate attempt to obscure the exact model of the aircraft from passengers, perhaps out of embarrassment or a misguided attempt to sidestep potential scrutiny. This lack of transparency is not just a matter of corporate image; it directly impacts passenger safety by not fully informing them about the aircraft they are flying in.

I have flown countless times all over the US and I have never had an encounter like the one from this week. Typically, you could have issues on one leg of the trip not both. Going to San Antonio, somehow our luggage ends up in Phoenix while we are in Texas. We came from a region where the temperature was 30 degrees and landed in full winter gear in a region that was 81 degrees with no luggage. “Go buy what you need and we will reimburse you for that and your luggage”. Okay…accidents happen, we can do that! However, on the way back  get to the airport to leave, “Your flight into Dallas is delayed causing you to miss your connecting flight into Omaha. The next flight is fully booked with no reasonable expectation that you can get standby. We can’t get you into Omaha for 2 days”. “Okay so you are going to put us in a hotel or reimburse us, correct?” “No! It’s weather related.” On radar the “storm” was the day before, has long since cleared the area, and nothing current or on the horizon. We have kids, animals, and other responsibilities at home that we must be back today but you expect us to sleep on the airport floor for 2 days.  We are left to figure out our own way home after we get checked in to Dallas. Flight out of San Antonio gets delayed 3x and there are no rental cars within 25 miles of the Dallas airport and none open that do have vehicles. We find seats open on a flight to Kansas City which the employee originally said was full, go get booked onto that flight. Closest we could get to Omaha but still have to rent a car and drive home. Get to Dallas and our flight to KC gets delayed. Finally get to KC at 11:30 PM! Go to get our luggage but it never made it on the plane!! 3+ hour layover and y’all couldn’t even get that right. So there we were 2 1/2 & 4 hours away from home just to have to figure out yet again how we will get our belongings after everything else that we had to go through! We finally get the rental car after dealing with baggage issues for about an hour after our flight landed. Then we have to make the long drive home! We get home but it was strictly through our own perseverance not due to good customer service on behalf of your airline! Unbeknownst to you, I sat in the very last row by the flight attendants and could hear every single word of the conversation about how a “technical computer issue” was compounded by a weather event and instead of doing right by your passengers, your company decided to log the entire multi day situation under a “weather event” so that you did not have to make financial reimbursements or find accommodations for the passengers effected! You used the weather related incidents loophole in the US DOT “commitments to controlled delays” section to avoid a financial impact to your company, thus passing the cost to your customers in lieu of being accountable for an already existing technical issue your airline had!

In total we had 4 flights with the airline, my main gripe refers to our flight from Miami to Belize which should have only been a 90 minute flight but was delayed for 9 hours. Firstly the previous crew had highlighted an electrical issue with our plane but we boarded relatively on time, only to taxi to the runway, do an about turn back to the stand as the fault had reoccurred. After sitting on the tarmac for about 40 minutes we were sent back to the terminal to await further news. The issue couldn't be fixed quickly so we awaited a replacement plane, which we subsequently found out had un resolved maintenance issues, time passed and we awaited a 3rd plane - again with issues, but which they could fix in a reasonable time. Several hours had passed at this point. The Pilot's working hours had then expired to we had to wait for another pilot, again 2 attempts to find a pilot, then the first officer's hours expired, again await another first officer. 9hrs later we finally left Miami, missed a day of our holiday, had to pay extra transport costs due to the very late arrival of the plane. The end result being a paltry $50 credit with the airline that I will never be flying with again. On the outbound UK flight some of the crew were rude - having been asked if headphones came in child sizes by another passenger I overhead a crew member walk away sniggering saying who does he think we are Target! They ran out of meat meals and thrust veggie options at us, with a 'tough this is all we have left' attitude. On the inbound flight having had to wait 20 minutes for wine with my meal that had long been eaten I was virtually thrown a bottle - with no glass to drink it with. We are seasoned travellers and I've never experienced such appalling service and from a well established airline I certainly didn't expect it. Needless to say I won't ever be flying with them again.

In seeking compensation, our first response from American Airlines was the offer of a mere 2,500 bonus miles, a gesture that felt dismissively inadequate given the scale of our inconvenience and loss. Upon expressing our dissatisfaction and outlining the extent of our losses, including the missed family event and its emotional significance, American Airlines then proposed a marginally improved but still insufficient compensation of 17,500 miles. Our continued correspondence highlighted the disparity between our actual losses and the compensation offered, emphasizing that the financial and emotional impacts far exceeded what was being acknowledged. Despite our appeals for a fair and balanced compensation reflective of the full extent of our inconvenience and financial losses, the final counter offer received was a $300 credit. This amount represents only a fraction of the cost of the tickets. Accepting this credit did not equate to satisfaction with the resolution. It merely shows the extent to which American Airlines falls short of providing adequate care and compensation.

Miserable employees and terrible customer service have been a consistent theme with American on almost all of our trips, but this trip was likely our last straw. We were delayed an hour and 20 minutes due to a mechanical issue coming out of New Orleans. Our layover was only 45 minutes in DFW, so unfortunately this moderate delay meant we’d miss our connection. No problem, this was an afternoon flight, there are 2 more flights from DFW to SFO. American oversells their flights out of DFW and bumps so many passengers that all flights to SFO were fully booked until 6 PM the following day, or just under 24 hours after we were supposed to land. Keep in mind that’s like 6 flights that are booked out. We’re ok to go to San Jose or Oakland to try to get home same day. Nope, nothing there either. I see options to divert on united, delta, and JetBlue to get home before 1 AM and not miss another day of work. Their contract only covers united and delta diversions and they don’t see these options in their system. Ok, can the customer service team escalate? No… if it’s not on their computer screen, there’s nothing they can do. And I have top tier one world status, would hate to not have status. I’ve had this situation happen before, American somehow took possession of a British airways reservation during a check in screw up by their agent last year which meant BA could not physically check me into the flight that I was supposed to be on. the phone agent in the UK for American successfully diverted me to a virgin flight to help rectify the mistake that would have kept me in London several extra days due to flight schedules and availability. Crisis averted, the agent went above and beyond and fixed the mistake. These American agents stateside would not hear of such a thing, they don’t call other airlines. I ask to speak to a supervisor. They take around 15 minutes and then get back on the phone and just tell me “this is so and so, she will explain how things work to you.” Probably the worst phrase you could say to a frustrated customer and a basic customer service mistake. Basically, “I’m not going to listen to you, you listen to me.” Awesome. So now I’m on with the supervisor, and she repeats his lines. Not willing to call. If it’s not on her screen it doesn’t exist to American despite flight availability online. And he was their chief advisor so if her employee couldn’t figure it out, no one could. I fear for those that get the non customer advisor customer service people. She isn’t able to help, I’ll deal with it at the airport. At the airport, our checkin person was probably new as she had to ask for help a number of times, but we had a weird situation and she did her best. She was very polite. We accept that we need to fly out the next morning and they’ll put us up at a hotel in Dallas during our layover. We land at 7:20 and are out at an airport holiday inn, which is fine. They have a shuttle, great. We call for the shuttle, it’s going to be 15 to 20 minutes. Not Americans fault on this part, but we were picked up an hour later and then drive around the airport for another hour before heading to the hotel. Not joking. We check in at 10:30.

Our flights are delayed again today for 2 hrs and we we won’t be home until past midnight. We have to get home to our 11 month old daughter who isn’t feeling well and nothing can be done.

I do know that many other planes landed and took off while our plane circle the airport on Flight Aware, before being re-routed to another airport. due to this, the next flight I was placed on was delayed due to an inoperable jetway and then another delay due to the push vehicle not functioning, which had to be disconnected from the plane and have a new one brought in. Then, once finally in Chicago, flight 6030, the plane I was told by one of the AA representatives in Houston that I would be in the first (Priority) standby position, was delayed due to a maintenance issue. This plane was delayed due to a switch on the plane that was malfunctioning. Eventually, it was determined that the repair could not be made and so that flight was switched to another plane at another gate. Once at the new gate, I am told I am in the second standby position and not the first as I was told I would be. As I now mentioned to the attendant at the new gate, I only had limited time to get to the bus terminal to catch the last bus of the night back to Milwaukee, my final destination, if I was not seated on this flight. They advised me I would get a seat and that I should wait until boarding was completed. I was not given a seat on this plane which led to me missing the last bus of the night to Milwaukee. I then went back to an AA representative to find out when was the next flight I could be put on to Milwaukee. I was informed it would be around 1:00 PM on the following day. Of course the expectation (as told to me by AA personnel) was for me to spend the night in the airport waiting for this plane. At this point, I chose to hire an Uber ride back to Milwaukee at a cost of $108.00 plus a tip. So, there were far more things that went on besides a simple weather delay. I was looking for compensation for mechanical breakdowns, my aggravation at being misled by AA personnel and the cost of my Uber ride. AA then offered me a $25.00 voucher for use on my next flight with them, along with an explanation that this was all their policies would allow for.

According to Sarah Gianni, a Customer Relations from American Airlines, our family arrived at their check-in counter at 5:30 am, and upon showing our ticket reservation, the American Airlines ticket agent started to accuse us of being “late”, accused us of being late to the counter, she said there was no way we could make it to the flight and she refused to check us in.\\xa0 I told her our flight leaves at 6:57 am, and we still can make it.\\xa0 We asked the agent to double-check, to see if we were indeed going to miss our flight, and the American Airlines ticket agent refused to check and just replied \"No way\".\\xa0 She scolded us that we should know better than to be there at least 5 hours ahead, during the holidays, to check in early.\\xa0The agent seemed to be overwhelmed and very rude to us told us to go away, and refused to help us in any way.

See below for reference: Site AND app state, in this exact wording: You can reserve a meal beginning 30 days (and up to 24 hours) before your flight. Available within 30 days of departure EVERY time Ive come across this issue, Im told its not available to reserve yet, even though its been 30 or less days prior to flight. Web techies could save us (and AA reps) time by adjusting this information to read less misleadingly. Idea: “You can reserve a meal up to 24 hours before your flight. (In select cases, this option may be available as early as 30 or less days before departure.)” Ive contacted them several times about this over the years. Nothing has changed. 2.They never have vegan options, only vegetarian. Most reps seem to not know the difference between the two. When I have had to speak with one over the phone, many times, Im given attitude, as if Im simply being picky and a nuisance. Veganism is more than just a diet - it’s an entire lifestyle, much like religious restrictions, such as kosher. I wonder if religious restrictions are given the same impatient attitude. I doubt it. Whats the problem with people who arent vegan getting so threatened with veganism? Im not preaching to them or trying to convert! Live and let live with respect. Solution: provide vegan options.

We faced several issues that significantly impacted our journey, leading to disappointment with American Airlines. Flight Delay and Layover Missed: Initially informed in Orlando about a delay due to mechanical issues, we understood these things happen. However, this delay caused us to miss our connecting flight in Phoenix.  Miscommunication at the Counter: The representative in Orlando hastily rebooked us on the next morning’s flight. Despite our inquiries about alternative flights, even at our own additional expense, we were assured unnecessary and guaranteed seats on the next flight. This turned out to be misleading. Standby Tickets Without Notice: At our gate, we discovered our Phoenix to Seattle tickets were actually on standby - a critical detail omitted by the staff. When we called American Airlines, we were informed we were 17th in line on the standby list.  Altered Travel Plans and Additional Expenses: Our original arrival in Seattle was scheduled for 3 AM on December 23. Due to these changes, not only was our arrival delayed to 10 AM, but with the standby status, we wouldn’t depart from Phoenix until 3:20 PM. This forced us to incur unexpected hotel expenses.  Unacknowledged Paid Seat Upgrades: We had paid an extra $100 for better seats for our Phoenix to Seattle flight. Given our standby status, this seems like an expense unlikely to be refunded.  Lack of Transparency and Assistance: The situation was exacerbated by a lack of honest communication from the beginning. When explaining our situation, the response from American Airlines was unhelpful, offering no compensation, such as a food voucher, or a genuine apology.  Final Decision: This experience has profoundly affected our view of American Airlines. Despite my wife’s cousin being a pilot for the airline, we are deeply disappointed. We expected more from an airline with a history of poor reviews. The lack of customer service and poor communication has led us to decide against using American Airlines in the future, regardless of cost.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our flight out of Roatan arrived almost 30 minutes late which left only an hour and a half to make our connection to Las Vegas. Even though we ran as fast as late 60\\'s year old people could, we got to our gate at 7:16pm for a 7:29pm departure only to find that the attendants had already closed the gate and wouldn\\'t reopen it. Apparently, they have a policy of closing the gate 15 minutes prior to the departure time - the hell with the customers that had been delayed by their own airline. My guess is to make sure they boost their \"on time arrival\" statistics. We went to the customer service desk to discuss alternatives to find out that our bags had made the flight. It\\'s inconceivable to me that. with the technology available and in use, they wouldn\\'t cross check the bags with the passengers and realize that there had been a delay. The customer service attendant and I spent almost an hour looking for flights and discussing options to finally determine that the next available flight that made any sense would be the next day. Because of the miles of red tape and caveats of American Airlines missed flight because of delays policy, we were informed that lodging and food would not be paid for - it was going to be our cost. So, at about 9:00pm we found a hotel near the airport. I have been a loyal flyer of American Airlines in the past while I was working and traveling extensively. In fact, they were the first frequent flyer program I joined back in the 1980\\'s and I was platinum level for many years. At one time, American was the premier customer service oriented airline flying. I sought them out because of their exemplary service and customer mindset. Unfortunately, they have devolved into one of the worst when it comes to that! They are more expensive than most, and their policies are nothing short of criminal. They have followed the pack in charging for bags (still at the top of the most ridiculous fees in the history of ripoffs), and become no better than Frontier or Spirit when it comes to charging extra for certain seats. It used to be at least they didn\\'t charge for the economy seats when you checked in after 24 hours in advance. Now it was a $10-12 fee to choose a seat during that time! We originally booked the flights for the economy fare of $711. A couple of months later they had dropped to $552 and, since economy bookers have zero rights, we couldn\\'t cancel and rebook. You would think that an airline making gazillions of dollars anyway would see fit to pay for a hotel and food when they made an additional $320 from us. It\\'s virtually impossible to contact a real person from American and, even if I did, I would get the stock, scripted answer regarding their policies. I don\\'t think it\\'s unreasonable for them to reimburse my costs of around $125 for them causing us to have to stay overnight after missing the flight. But customer service and common sense have disappeared from the airline industry. That\\'s why I will never fly American again and give Southwest my business - no baggage nor change fees and they at least make an attempt at providing good customer service and experiences.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

I will never fly American Airlines again! Our flight out of Omaha got delayed 8 hours, causing us and almost everyone else on board to either miss connections, or miss their cruise ships out of Miami. The staff at the airport was rude and refused to answer any questions on why we were delayed and for how long. By the time they decided to let us all know when the flight would be leaving, there was no chance to book with another airline and still make our connections. Of course, AA had no other flights to the Grand Caymans that day, so they booked us a room in Miami and scheduled us on the first flight out of Miami the next morning. When we arrived at the hotel that AA had booked for us, the police were raiding the hotel, there were bullet holes in the floor, the place was filthy, and there was no way I was going to stay there. We called AA to have them change hotels for us and we were informed that they couldn\\'t do anything over the phone, that we would need to go back to Miami International and find an AA customer service desk to get a hotel change, otherwise we were welcome to find a hotel on our own and save the receipt and AA would reimburse us. Fine. By this time, we had been \"traveling\" (not that I would call it that) for over 18 hours and decided to just find a hotel close to the airport and call it a night. It was 8:30 pm at this time. We got a hotel and back to the airport the next morning. The flight the next morning seemed to be going smoothly until they got everyone on board and backed away from the gate. We then sat on the tarmac for over an hour and a half with no air conditioning (apparently the mechanical issue was the air conditioner). It ended up being over 90 degrees inside this airplane that was over packed. The entire time, we sat and listened to the staff laugh, joke, and complain about the \"bonuses\" they all had just received for the holiday.  Zero professionalism and rude to customers who were asking for water due to the excessive heat inside the aircraft. When we finally made it back from our trip, we submitted the request to be refunded for the hotel, our meals, and the hotel and excursion we had booked in the Caymans but were unable to make it to. AA customer relations representative would not accept some of our receipts, offered us a $200 trip credit to fly AA again and sent a check that was not even half the cost of the hotel room ($142), much less any other of our expenses. When I complained to customer relations again, I was informed that the amount I was refunded was the \"policy amount\" set for that date and location. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that the person I was speaking to was the last person I would speak to, there are no supervisors, and no other departments above them. I cannot believe that an airline allows this to happen.

I also stated that the people in are seats should go on standby not us. American only told me we where put on stand by and to take it up with customer service. We had waited over 5-hours on standby each time we where told flight was overbooked, Finally two seats came available around 0630 pm and the boys said they would get the next two seat that came up. My wife an I arrived in Nashville at 0930 pm and had to call a friend to pick us up. My wife received a message from the boys that they may need to get a hotel since it wasn’t looking good By now I’m extremely furious at 0345 am the boys finally arrived in Nashville and had to pay $160 for an Uber to get to us.

After 2 1/2 hours they got it worked out and we almost missed our flight. Once in London we had a 5-hour layover and everything went great with British Airways and our flight to Munich .

The soonest they claimed they could get us to Punta Cana was 6:00PM the NEXT day. For no particular reason other than there was no room in other connecting flights for the rest of the day.

They didn’t offer any other accommodations such as food, quicker flights, or some sort of refund. We will be losing money on our all inclusive resort that we paid for. We tried to change the day we leave our honeymoon after we found out about this delay to have more time on vacation, but there were limited options available through American Airlines and now there’s the concern that our flight home will get delayed as well. Normally I’m an easygoing person but this has been an absolutely horrible experience, a ruined honeymoon, and money lost. We worked so hard to be able to afford this vacation, to have the time off for work, and we haven’t been on a vacation together before.

I explained to her that I cannot make my dog turn around in the pet carrier on common. They then stated that my dog needed to be under 16 lbs to fly. This also isn’t the policy on their website, the dog needs to be under 20 lbs. I had to say, “will you please listen to me. I flew round trip on American, this was not an issue. I again, explained to both of them that this is not my first time flying with my dog, and that I am a physician and I need to get back so I could go to work tomorrow.” The supervisor then asked me for my record locator. By this time, another supervisor was on the phone with the 1st supervisor and stated that they can allow for me to take my dog. The supervisor then told me that I got lucky this time and to buy another carrier. She then stated to me they have different protocols at other airports but in Austin they follow the rules. I said to her that you are telling me that the AA ticket agents in Philadelphia, Kentucky, both Chicago airports and Indianapolis were all wrong, but the two of you were the only ones who were correct?

This is despite AA’s claim on CNN and USA Today that AA will seat families together for no extra cost. When I asked her about the rights of families to be seated together, and the guarantee that had been made the manager asked me how about the rights of the other passengers who paid for their seat? Why should you as a family with small children get a priority ? She then told me go inside and discuss it with the passengers feigning complete lack of empathy. Of course, when I went in, the passengers refused to switch their seat because they said they paid extra for it. When I spoke to the air hostess, she said that this happened on a weekly basis, and that people were not willing to give up their seats. For this flight American Airlines was selling individual aisle seats for a higher price, after families had booked on basic economy, even after they knew that families needed the seats to be together, and when families came in all the aisle seats were taken, and so they were all separated. At the time of reservation even though the seats had been available, the families were not seated together automatically even under the same reservation. This violates the guarantee on their website. The truth is American Airlines is not family friendly and it seems they need customer service training and child focused training if they want to become a family friendly airline. Currently the PR and their actual service are mis-matched as the managers didn’t seem to know about the guarantees the company make online, neither did the air crew it seems. Eventually I had to beg and pay people myself to get them to let me sit with my kids. It was extremely nerve-racking. All this while on my children were crying with no real support from the air hostess. We need solid legislation to enforce airlines to meet the statements they make. If they can’t seat family together and see there are two small children and a parent traveling on a flight they need to inform the passenger at the moment of booking that the seats will not be together. They should not try to sell the seats to individual passengers and then at a later point tell families there is no seating or that they need to pay extra, leaving them at the discretion of other passengers. AA is prioritizing profit over families.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The hotel left much to be desired and we ended up getting an Uber because the line was so long to get a shuttle. We also found out that a flight to Paris was also cancelled. The next day we came back we sat in an area and left our travel pillows and a set of crutches in a back seating area. We grabbed lunch and came back to the area with a flight attendant sitting there. She said those were her pillows and we couldn’t sit there. We asked why and she said it was for crew. I asked why we couldn’t sit there because there was no signage for indicating we couldn’t sit there. She asked if I knew I was talking to and I said are you an employee.

Flying out of STL, connecting in DFW, we arrived 3hrs early for a 7am flight, the flight was delayed 30 min. So I called AA and made sure we were still good for our connection. As soon as I got off the phone the flight was delayed for 7 hours, I called again and was on hold.

At the same time I was searching for other flights to make it to Mexico in time for the wedding (all while still on hold). When we got up to ticketing there was a long line and only about 2 people assisting (and one guy on the phone the entire time - not helping the line). When I finally reached the desk, I pointed out a Delta flight that would get us there and the agent said well you would have had to be checked in on the flight by 730 so I can\\'t put you on it (it was 735). After two hours on hold they finally answered. They then booked us on a flight to charlotte and then on to Dallas - so we could make the DFW to PVR trip the next day and still make it in time for the wedding. We go back through security and to our gate (no meal voucher, and they told us that we would get a hotel voucher in Dallas). When boarding flight 831 to CLT they made us gate check our bags (our only luggage) after boarding the plane they had mechanical issues and removed all passengers. They said Mechanical issues and it would only be 45 minutes. We received a notification on the app that we had been rebooked. and would again miss our flight in DFW and miss the wedding. At this point we knew it would be faster to drive the 10hrs to Dallas to make our flight the next morning since American could not find any other way to get us to get us to Mexico in time. We stood in line again at the gate agent to see what we could do about the bags that we were forced to check. They said they would not pull bags off of the flight and that we would get them in Dallas. So we got in our car and drove the 10hrs to DFW, we immediately went to the ticket desk and asked about our bags (the Charlotte flight eventually took off around 9pm so about 7 hrs late), The agent informed us that our bags will be catching up with us and be there when we arrive in PVR. 2 gate changes later we boarded and made it to Puerto Vallarta. Our bags didn\\'t arrive. We immediately filed a missing baggage report with the AA representative and continued on our way (having to purchase clothes and necessities since our bags were lost/ delayed) We had to cancel our leg from DFW to STL on the way home since our car was there and drive home. We have since filed not only baggage but an expenses claim. Our baggage was denied since we were \"voluntarily separated\" from our bags, even though we were forced to check them, were rebooked by AA and still made the DFW flight that we needed.

That fob was in the suitcase during the entire vacation. Keep in mind that any baggage issues need to be reported to AA within ridiculously short periods of time to have any hope of processing a claim! Luckily, I acted pretty quickly and sent a message describing what had happened. Unluckily, I was now entering the Twilight Zone of such claims processes with AA! They sent a reply with a link to their claims process. Immediately, it was evident that this could not be done automatically. AA’s auto system will absolutely not let you submit any claim that does not have a specific receipt for the item lost. No flexibility. No options offered. So, now I’m through the looking glass of trying to handle this by phone. The first person listened to the whole thing and told me he was not the right person, but would transfer me. I, having dealt with many such customer service systems said (very nicely) that I’d rather not explain that same story seven times. Was the next dept. going to be the correct one? “Oh, yes sir.” Of course, it was not. After explaining it 2 more times, I got the proper dept. Now, came the requests for receipts again! This is a fob! It has no specific receipt. I calmly said that I thought a call to Belize City and Dallas airports to check their found items might do the trick. I was placed on hold and, when she got back on the phone, I was told that Belize City did not have it and Dallas Ft. Worth was their headquarters and was so busy that it would be hard to get a hold of anyone! That needs repeating, Dallas Ft. Worth was their headquarters and was so busy that it would be hard to get a hold of anyone! After way too much chat, it was decided I could send proof of the car purchase, of all the insane things. Also, they wanted an estimate of replacement value. So, I went to our initial dealership and got the parts dept. to send me an estimate, which I forwarded to AA, with proof of flights and ID. The estimate clearly pointed out that the fob transmitter is $101.30, the physical key kept inside the fob is $62.66, and the programming of the fob to our vehicle (absolutely necessary, as is known by anyone who has operated a vehicle with such a device!) $165. With tax, the total was going to be $347.05. They took all this info. and replied that they would be sending a check for $80.75!

She was extremely rude and talked over me when I tried to explain that I could not get out of my seat while in flight without assistance. This airline claims to accommodate disabled people but I did not feel they even tried in this instance.  Absolutely no compassion whatsoever. I tried to file a complaint with the airline regarding this matter and although the customer service that helped me write the complaint was wonderful the response I received was a very generic reply. I have been unable to speak to anyone regarding this and the email response to my submission was basically an apology “but we don’t feel as though our employees did anything wrong!” So in summary I will never fly with American again and I definitely would say that in regards to accommodations for people with disabilities they probably don’t even comply with the basics required.

Almost every trip requires a connection, with about 85 - 90% of those connections being in Charlotte. It is kind of funny that lot of the budget airlines, like Spirit & Frontier among others offer a majority of direct travel all across Canada & The US. How is American Airlines not jumping on this. Honestly, a stopover is not bad, especially if you love flying, like I do. However with American, a stopover is a bittersweet thing. Firstly, a stopover could be anywhere 40 minutes to 1 hour. Hearing that you initially think \"OK, not bad at all\" then you have your first flight delayed for a bogus reason, rendering your connection pointless, which is frustrating. Frustration increases usually because with American Airlines, your first flight will be an evening flight, and after the delay, you get to your connection 1 hour late if not more, and you have to stay all night in the airport to get your connecting flight first thing in the morning. Yay! If you are lucky to get a representative at a ticket booth, which will be few & far between if that, you will be given some sort of miss-information in regards to why your flight was delayed.

Like us customer are the inconvenience. After saying no, I actually had a representative tell me \"You can certainly book a flight with United\" what kind of answer is that. Your airline messes up and your advice is have a customer pay more money with a different airline. Alright then! WiFi on American is not the best either, unless you are a Xfinity or Verizon member. If not, don\\'t expect any internet access besides the American Airlines site allowing you to check other American Airlines flights to see your connecting flight is on time and knowing you will miss it. Prices for WiFi on the airline range from $15 - $20, just to use the WiFi on 1 device only. Oh Joy! I do realize airlines screw up sometimes, it\\'s a part of travel. The whole \"it\\'s about the journey, not the destination\" thing. However, at least have the decency to be honest with customers about what is going on and try to accommodate them. The very least you can do is try to keep the customer. At least with your own airline. As much as I love flying, a direct flight is certainly better than this headache I endured.

A lot of money! I fly monthly and I always fly first class. When I got to the airport I went to scan my e-ticket which clearly showed I have a first class seat. The machine said I was too late to check luggage. It didn’t make sense. I was 2 hours early. A very nice woman helped me and she fixed it and checked my luggage. And I got my luggage tickets and my luggage was marked priority. When I went to check in at the gate I was told to step aside. A female agent said the ticket not in the system despite my having my boarding pass. So she asked a male agent to assist me. He was extremely mean and rude. He said I wasn’t on the flight. I showed him my confirmation email, my e-ticket that showed my seat number and he said it didn’t matter. I don’t exist in in the system. He then assigned me a new seat in economy. I told him I paid for a first class ticket. He said you didn’t tell me that. Ask for a refund. Had he actually looked at my ticket he would’ve seen that I was first class. I didn’t want to make scene so I moved on. When I passed through the first class cabin my seat was empty. I do not know if it filled after, but I was one of the last ones on the plane. I imagine it went empty. I probably should have just showed my e ticket and I could have sat down, but honestly I was so taken back by the way I was just treated I wasn’t thinking. I have sent an email to my travel agent to ask her how I can get a refund of the difference. I fly first class because I fly frequently and it helps me to me rested for important meetings. I spend a lot of my hard earned money. I was treated horribly by the agent at the gate. I do not tolerate that behavior and do not reward it with further business. I can tell you, I will absolutely never fly American Airlines ever again and I will never recommend them to any body ever again based on my experience on this particular trip. I don’t appreciate being treated so badly. There was no cause for him to be this way, other than he enjoyed pushing his weight around.

But I spent 10 hours at the airport to basically find my own solution. 3 visits to the customer service line and 2 phone calls before I decided this is ridiculous. My first flight out I missed by 5 mins even though I watched them give other stand by people my seat. There was a bad storm that delayed everyone. I was put on stand by 3 times before I’m like no this can not be the solution. My 3rd visit to customer service was met with limited reps and basically the last rep showing no empathy after I’ve been running around the entire airport for 7 hours just to get oh no the flight is overbooked. I ended up just purchasing a new ticket through JetBlue and let my anxiety not get the best of me. The reason I missed my flight is because pre-check took 40 mins to get through. No one had a sense of urgency. 10 people missed my flight so don’t you think that’s a big issue. I get it if it was only me but 10. The same people running from flight to flight. American wanted to wait on standby until the next day. I'm on a business trip for work there is no next business day. I'm just upset that it took so much time waiting to get no resolution and then me deciding to take my fate into my own hand where it got resolved.

As a loyal customer, I had accumulated over 300,000 American Airlines points, but their redemption process left much to be desired. Despite having a substantial number of points, I was unable to use them effectively or receive the benefits I expected. One of the most frustrating aspects of my journey was no seat selection options, particularly when traveling with children. It is unfathomable that an airline of American Airlines' stature would not prioritize the comfort and convenience of families. With no control over seat assignments, we were left scrambling to find suitable seats, causing unnecessary stress and discomfort. Adding to my disappointment, there were no options to upgrade, even when I was willing to pay for an upgrade. This lack of flexibility was particularly disheartening considering the length of my journey. Traveling from the USA to Vietnam with a layover in Japan for over 9 hours meant that comfort and quality service were crucial. Unfortunately, American Airlines/Japan Airline failed to deliver on these fronts. To make matters worse, the return trip mirrored the same problems. The absence of reliable customer support was particularly frustrating. There was no one to turn to for assistance or to address our concerns. This lack of accountability and communication left me feeling abandoned and unsupported throughout my entire journey. Furthermore, both of my flights experienced delays during boarding. This additional inconvenience only served to exacerbate an already frustrating experience, leaving me questioning the airline's commitment to punctuality and customer satisfaction. In light of this disappointing experience, I am left wondering about the value of retaining my American Airlines points or why anyone would choose to remain loyal to the airline. The inability to utilize my points effectively and the overall lack of customer-centric services have seriously diminished my trust in American Airlines. I sincerely hope that American Airlines takes these concerns seriously and addresses the numerous issues faced by their passengers. Until they demonstrate significant improvements in their services and customer support, it is difficult to recommend them or have faith in their loyalty program. Please note that this review reflects my personal experience, and others may have had different encounters. However, based on my own journey, I would caution potential travelers to consider these factors before booking a flight with American Airlines or their code share partner, Japan Airlines.\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our flight out of Albuquerque was late, but we boarded an hour late and thought we would make our connecting flight. We sat for another hour in the plane and were told there was a cabin light that was not working and did not need to be fixed to fly, but the pilot chose to hold the plane up anyway. We had to run to our connecting gate at DFW. Our luggage did not get on the plane. When we got to Key West, a baggage claim employee told us we would probably not get our bags until the 4:30 flight the next day. We just questioned why as there was two earlier flights. She apparently did not like being questioned and just gave us our baggage tickets back and said there was nothing else she could do. We were getting married the next day and all our wedding attire was in those bags! We called the airline customer service the next morning and found out she never filed a baggage claim ticket tracking either and were told the bags would be on the 1:20 flight from Miami. When we went to the airport to get the bags, the baggage claim supervisor had taken our bags off the carousel, came into the terminal, called our names and we were instructed to go talk to him at the baggage claim window. He told us that Tracy had indicated we were intoxicated and using foul language when speaking to her the day before. Both of those statements were a lie. Unless American Airlines over serves their customers, there is no way we were drunk. We were on their planes from 9 am until 4:30 pm with no layovers. Secondly, my fiance does not swear, just ridiculous! He told us we had two options, either apologize to the staff or he would send our luggage with a delivery service and we would get it sometime that day. We told him we were getting married in a few hours and our wedding attire was in those bags. He said he understood, but those were our options. So he held our luggage hostage and basically forced us to apologize to the staff for something that never happened, just so we could get our luggage and get married. I would like to know where our apology is from American for ruining our entire wedding day! I cried all night and most of the next morning because we thought we were going to have to cancel our wedding.

This was our first time with American and also our last. We flew from Munich via Charlotte to Charleston, South Carolina. On our flight from CLT to CHS, we were already about one and a half hours delayed, apparently due to an aircraft change. That in itself wasn’t nice, but if would’ve been somewhat acceptable. The real problems started on our return flight back to Munich, as we left CHS with a delay of over 2 hours. Since AAs schedule is ridiculously tight, the delay caused us (and many other passengers with connecting flights) to miss our connections. We missed our flight by a grand total of 5 minutes, because they couldn’t hold the aircraft an additional five minutes (especially since we weren’t the only ones running to catch that specific flight). We were then sent to a service desk to arrange a re-booking and initially hoped to be re-booked onto a later flight with Lufthansa or British Airways (which is a Oneworld member so re-booking would’ve been logical), but the agent didn’t even bother to check if they had any seats available and just told us we’d have to wait 24 hours for the next flight with AA since they only re-book passengers to another airline if they can’t get you to your destination within 24 hours. While they did give us two hotel rooms for the night, they only provided one food voucher (12$ per person, which was absolutely ridiculous. In the end, I missed parts of my university exams and my father missed an important business meeting, both of which we would’ve been able to attend had we been re-booked to British Airways. Oh and while I’m at it: don’t expect to get your luggage before departing for the hotel. We asked to retrieve it and were told, we’d have to wait between 2-8 hours to get it delivered (keep in mind, it was 7pm), which meant we were stuck in the hotel (which thankfully provided some amenities) with just our carry-ons. It became apparent there is no communication between and knowledge of other departments with AA staff since the re-booking agent told us we‘d get our bags right away, while the guys at the baggage claim said the above. The baggage guys (also from AA) even said there was no communication between departments and certainly no mutual help. This experience and the treatment we received was quite literally the worst we’ve ever had with any airline (and we are frequent fliers), be it a US or other airline. Just something I‘d like to add as well: when we arrived at the hotel, we were told that this treatment is quite common with AA and that, on average, they accommodate many AA passengers daily due to missed or cancelled connections. Though I feel obliged to point out that the flights and flight crews were actually quite good (good food, clean aircraft, friendly crew), but the management, as mentioned, is just horrible.

My flight was scheduled for 6:30 pm, and I arrived at the airport at 4 pm to go through the tedious security check. Upon reaching the gate, I was informed that my flight was delayed by an hour. As time passed, the delay kept extending, and we were eventually told that we would only be boarding the plane at around 9:45 pm to 10 pm. After boarding and taxiing for half an hour, the pilot announced that they had exceeded their allowed hours, and we would have to go back to the terminal. It was incredibly frustrating to have to go through the entire boarding process only to be turned back due to an issue that should have been sorted out beforehand. Upon returning to the terminal, we were informed that the flight had been canceled, and we would have to wait until the next day to fly out at 11:15 am. The process of waiting in line at the AA counter to secure a hotel reservation for the night was a frustrating two-hour ordeal. When I finally arrived at the hotel, I was informed that they had not received any information about my reservation. Luckily, they had a room available, but it was an unnecessary inconvenience after an already stressful day. The next day, we arrived at the airport at 8 am, went through security again, and boarded the plane. However, after only half an hour, we were informed that there was a technical issue with the plane, and we had to disembark yet again. I was fed up with the constant delays and decided to book a flight with United while waiting in line for a refund. The whole ordeal cost me $850 for a one-way ticket for myself and my wife.

The food, covered many times on this forum goes from bad to worse and in most cases is in fact inedible, I am quite sure that it has been many years since anyone in AA actually tasted or reviewed the food. The seat on the flight in the Flagship Business was not functioning and remained in the upright position for the entire flight, the only available seat was 1A which I was told was reserved by the FAA and in fact turned out 5 hours into the flight was for the captain to have a nap for 2 hours before returning to the cockpit. This really sums up everything about AA, the crew are more important than the paying passengers and the passengers are merely a distraction while the staff wait for their pensions or redundancies. As far as I know, no other 'reputable' airline puts its staff in premium seats, they use cabin rest areas, this seat should have been given up to accommodate the paying passenger, who also happens to be an Advantage Platinum member, what does it say about an airline that makes a paying passenger sit upright for 8 hours and lets the captain use a seat for a 2 hours when there is a crew rest area on the 777-200 aircraft?

American said they couldn't help because Iberia was in control of the seats and Iberia said they couldn't help because American sold me the tickets and were responsible for seating. The American Airlines representative even at one point said I could not get seat assignments because I wasn't part of the Platinum Program - I reminded her that these were not coach tickets and that I had paid for Business Class. She then went on to say that they have problems with Iberia and can't get seats assigned. She said we should have seats and when we check in at the gate they would be assigned there somewhere on the plane. I even asked if American Agent could message Iberia and make sure we had seats on the planes. She said she could not do so, but thought we would have seats if the flights weren't sold out. I told here we have tickets and she said she could see we had tickets purchased in Business Class and that we should have seats on the various flights.

Twenty minutes before boarding my first flight, I received notifications that my connecting flight was completely cancelled. No offer of explanation or reason and only the automated, \"We are working to resolve this\" statement. Only had available options for new flights, which were limited due to the fact that it was going to a very small airport with only one way in, therefore a known limited dependence on their airline. When I, myself, found another flight that would have gotten me to a nearby airport and presented to that gate in another terminal just as they were about to close, the representative at the gate denied my boarding, even though there was space, because, \"I did not have any visible interruptions on my record via the record locator\" because I had reflexively chosen the first available new flight option to have something  on the agenda. All that despite the multiple texts, emails, notification of the clear cancellation of my connecting arriving flight. 3After I was able to find an equivalent of this second alternative route with a pleasant LAX AA customer rep via United Airlines, both he and the United airlines rep reported that I still had my return flights. However, the next day when i was checking status of the flights, they no longer appeared, and I was no longer on those flights, I suspect due to the fact that I was never cancelled from my original flights and as I did not board those, it cancelled my returns. This was all discovered 6.5 hours prior to departure.  Even after I called and had those return flights rebooked under me, I had to ask the rep to check on the status, and only then did she relay that the outgoing first leg was already found to be delayed to arrive at my connecting airport 30-40 minutes after the connecting leg was supposed to takeoff, prompting to find ANOTHER alternative route, causing me to leave for home 5 hours earlier than expected for an already short trip. Because of all these changes, I have had the extra expense of finding a last minute rental car, as the alternative airport was 95 miles away, and the corresponding gas. Then I had to change the rental return last minute. Again, still no courtesy to explain why I was heavily inconvenienced at all in the first place. No offer to proactively help other than the automated, \"Here are alternative flights\". If I had not been proactive, I would have flown out of my original airport and gotten stuck at the layover for over 12 hrs, and arrived at my destination with less than 24hrs to spend.

Using the American Airlines app with the early check-in was easy. Mobile boarding passes are the GOAT. The app also helped me find my way from gate to gate in the Charlotte airport with approximate walking time. In fear of hiccups, I made sure my carry-on had everything I needed in the event my luggage didn't make the trip. I put an air tag in my luggage just for my own peace of mind. But the app also enabled me to know that my luggage was on board, so when I went to the baggage claim, I knew it was coming out eventually. No stress. For my trip out, I planned a long layover in Charlotte but on the way back, I changed my original flight and the choices were limited. My layover was less than an hour in Charlotte and I was a little worried about making my connecting. I was flying back two days after the Super Bowl, so there's that too. Honestly, all my flights were early upon arrival and I had no issues whatsoever with luggage. The in-flight crew was very friendly and helpful. Seriously, no bad vibes from anyone at all. You know how it can be -- people are professional and helpful, but somewhat unfriendly. That certainly was not the case at American Airlines in my experience. Obviously, I can't speak to what the service would've been like had issues arisen. In the event my flight didn't make my connecting on time on the way home, I was prepared to re-book and find a place close to stay for the night. Like I said above, I fully expected there might be hiccups and tried to anticipate them to the best of my ability - and stay calm Getting upset, while sometimes unavoidable, only makes things worse. I will also add that I witnessed no negative encounters during any of my four flights or while at the airports. In a day and age where you're sort of at the mercy of what you hear/read internet or other news, and when that news tends to spotlight everything that's wrong with our world, I would not have been surprised to witness or hear people being rude to each other, to staff, or just in general. Traveling is tiring. Airplane seating is tight. People get frustrated. I am happy to report that my trips were filled with kindness and courtesy.

At this point I had no idea this was happening because my boarding pass was still visible on the app for all my flights. At the second airport, I had my boarding pass in the app readily available, walked up to the gate to scan it, and the gate agent stated that my ticket was cancelled and my seat had already been given to someone else. He claimed that I cancelled it myself in the app, which I 100% did not do and never received an email, text, notification, etc that my ticket was cancelled. Luckily they were able to squeeze me on the last flight of the night, but I was panicking thinking I was gonna have to spend the night in a strange city I’ve never been to before! The gate agents were not very empathetic to my situation. I spoke with the representative on the help line who was unable to help me, so I filed a complaint with corporate who also blamed the entire situation on me and was no help.

Check in at SAN took about 2 hours at the counter while the agent tried to add the infants to our group. Paid for the infants and finally was told all was done, booked through the roundtrip. Tried to board at 10:00 pm the codeshare Finnair in NY JFK and was told the infants had no tickets. Finnair said that AA didn't transfer to infants' tickets to Finnair. Went to AA desk and they tried to do the transfer but couldn't before the flight left. We waited at the AA desk from 10:00 PM to 1:30 AM while they tried to do this transfer. We had four young children in a very uncomfortable situation during this wait. About 11:00 PM I asked the agent to just process the hotel stay, since that was obviously necessary, so we could get the children to sleep. The agent was surly, and insisted that she finish the ticket transfer process first. This was not finished until 1:30 AM, and we were very distressed and unhappy. To make matters worse the local AA manager insisted it was Finnair's problem while the AA agent who finally got it transferred acknowledged it to be AA's fault. Every AA agent we interacted with was rude and unhelpful for our situation. On our return out of Helsinki only one of the infants' tickets was in the system, and it took hours and calls to AA tech support while we waited at the Finnair checkin counter to get this fixed. Luckily we didn't miss the flight because we got to the airport at 4:30 AM, 3 hours before the flight.

The trip out, which I am not reviewing here, added 3 hours to our travel time which was a guessing game of, \"will we or won\\'t we\". The trip back was the doozy. We had a flight scheduled for 3 months. All locked up with seats selected and all. On the day of our travel home from Eagle, CO airport, we received a notice via the AA app that the flight was delayed and that we MUST choose another connecting flight because we\\'d miss our Chicago O Hare connection. So we do and the flight that was chosen via the app actually took us to DC instead of MD. We called to correct this item and that transfer only took 26 minutes on the phone. At this time, we were on the hour long bus ride to the airport to catch our now confirmed 240pm flight. As SOON as we got that confirmation, we checked the app immediately and there was another delay 2:40 to 4:02pm We figured, \"okay, things happen but let\\'s make the most of it\". We waited at the Eagle airport for 5 hours before the notifications started flying. Delayed again to 5pm. Again, looking like we\\'d miss our connecting flight again but then reassured by the staff at the check in desk that we\\'d be fine. I brought up that there seemed to be confusion with the app and the information that they had. Again, reassured that we\\'d be fine. The time finally rolled around to board and this same attendant came running up to us to apologize about the information she shared a half hour ago. We would in fact, likely not make our connecting flight. So, we took this flight anyway. Got to the airport and the plane taxied for a half hour to get to our terminal (this included wait time for a spot to open?). We asked the check in attendant if we could get to the next gate before they left, he said we could. He didn\\'t offer to radio ahead to hold the door for 5 minutes or anything. We ran. And I mean, almost had a heart attack ran to go the 20 gates to make the flight. They were pulling away as we showed up. The first time I\\'ve ever seen a plane pull away from the concourse on time ironically. The desk attendant of course couldn\\'t help us because all flights out of Texas apparently stop at 730pm? I expressed my displeasure with the fact that everyone would tell us there were delays, rarely did anyone know what system was disclosing the delays to customers and that no one could tell us why there were so many delays. We were told ,\"weather\". Not where the weather was bad but that there was \"weather\". Eagle was 28 degrees with blue skies and jets were taking off left and right. Texas was 65 degrees and Maryland was in the teens with no snow or ice. We were offered the very last flight out of Dallas but it would get us in to DC at 2am. We reluctantly accepted with confirmation of a ride from one of our good friends. Otherwise, we were stuck in a motel and another connecting flight through Charlotte to BWI.

I waited for my bags for two hours the night it was cancelled then was told to return the next morning. I went the next morning and requested my bag to be pulled, waited 6 hours and still no bag. Was told I’d be called once they found it. Heard nothing for three days then after calling around, I found out today my bag was sent to Omaha even though I never flew. Now I’m having to figure out how to get my baggage home to me without being lost again. This experience completely destroyed our holiday plans and the entire weekend. Throughout this whole experience it was impossible to get ANYONE from American to assist me in finding my baggage. The AA workers at the Charlotte baggage claim office were confrontational, unfriendly, insensitive and caused total chaos among all of the worried travelers. There were several other travelers in line beside me needing vital medications from their luggage and the staff showed no remorse, offering zero effort in trying to assist them. These people were told that this should be a “lesson” not to put medication in your checked bag!! I am so disappointed in the lack of assistance, communication and service that I had grown to expect from American Airlines. I don’t say this to be rude, I share this so that things can be addressed and changed so others don’t experience this in the future.

Little legroom, no footrest and a very minimal recline. I am 6' 4 ' and it was impossible to get comfortable and certainly not possible to sleep. We were not allowed to use any lounge despite being in First Class for all legs unless we paid $59.00 for a day pass. The lounges were nothing special and in LAX the ground personnel took pleasure in telling us that the showers were not available to passengers. Boarding all airports was a joke. When the flights are called all passengers surge forward and all the ground staff do is just accept the boarding passes, no control or finesse whatsoever. On board meals were so, so. Nothing exciting and certainly not served with any enthusiasm or pleasure. Only one round of drinks offered on a five hour flight, fortunately we had taken our own water on board. I would urge any future potential American passenger to be very careful and check what type of aircraft will be used, the A321 is a nice aircraft but the AA First Class cabin should be avoided, its just not worth the money.

The outward bound trip had almost a 3 hour delay getting on our connection flight from there to Nashville ... this was after the first long leg flight from Germany to Charlotte, so we already had a 3 hour layover as we had to customs in NC and collect our bag and bring it for drop off to our connection flight to Nashville. After doing all that we end up being delayed almost 3 hours (so 6 hours total at this Airport). We could have rented a car and driven to Nashville in that timeframe which we would have preferred honestly because then maybe our toddler would have gotten some sleep. Once we finally made it to Nashville the baggage crew had us waiting almost an hour for our bags. Now coming back to Germany trip is where it gets worse. Nashville flight to Charlotte everything was fine with exception the plane we had this time had like micro storage above that no one could fit their carry on bags which caused a lot of bag drop off and pick up at flight gate and of course our travel stroller is the last item that comes out getting off that flight in Charlotte NC to transfer to our connection to Frankfurt Germany. At that gate (D9 specifically) in Charlotte NC is where I was having to deal with the very rude woman at the gate and that\\'s where I\\'m positive I also ended up leaving behind my brand new jacket while I was being rudely talked down to and ultimately had to just walk away to avoid further confrontation with this American Airlines employee.

My husband and child continue boarding as we have a carseat to install and need the time to do this, so I\\'m standing there with my stroller on the measuring thing and it fits perfectly when she started telling me no it\\'s too big and comes right on the max line for size and demanding I bag and tag it. I question her on this and said it was no issue coming here and fit fine to which I\\'m told, \"I don\\'t care what they let you do on that flight you\\'re not allowed to bring that stroller as a carry on because I say it wont fit and I just told some first class couple the same too about their stroller, so if they can\\'t bring it neither are you!\".

I quickly board and get the travel bag from my husband and run back out to the gate entrance to bag and tag the stroller. While doing this I sit down my jacket close by and then become rushed by an different attendant about tagging the bag. I ask her to give me a minute bag it and she sticks on the tag and hands me my receipt and tells me to bring it the gate drop off where I saw someone else leave their stroller near plane entrance.

She is an unaccompanied minor which I paid extra for so you cannot use the app for boarding.

When I find this out I go straight to the Myrtle Beach airport to find out why my child is alone in Dallas. In the process she finds someone and ask about her chaperone and she is told that she is not on a list for a chaperone. A lady sits with her anyway but tells her that she will probably not have a chaperone when she gets to Charlotte. While I am at Myrtle Beach airport I find out that Anchorage airport put my child on the plane and did not list her as an unaccompanied minor so she was not chaperoned.

I never want to see another domestic carrier again. DFW/XNA this past Friday was one of the worst on record for me. A 42 minute flight was most deplorable. I have been tied to United, Delta, SW and even TWA, US AIR, Continental over the years until nearly all were absorbed by the Big 3. Now with AA exclusive since 1995. The perpetuated lies from pilots and maintenance personnel is just beyond the pale. It borders on harassment and being taken hostage. Yes the weather at DFW was sketchy on 10/28 but most every flight was moving in and out. I am OK with being delayed 2-3 hours if I am told the truth and updated, but 7 hours is horrid for passengers and AA staff. The lead FA and gate agent were on the verge of panic attacks because of the lies being told. The Captain just gets up and walks out without saying a word for he timed out on his duty hours. The FAs were furious he did this and they were calling their management over it. Secondly, How can a passenger expect they are being told the truth when you are told your aircraft \" has been taken out of service\" by maintenance only to reboard the same aircraft an hour later. I have my suspicions about that sequence of events but to long to go on in this forum. In the end the FAs saved us for they extended their duty hours to get us to XNA, otherwise we were screwed. Every passenger should be grateful to them as I was, even being 7 hours late. I read these comments about AA, it is shameful that a once premier domestic carrier and brand is now rated as a 2 star carrier. Its shameful that AA management does not care one ounce for their staff nor the passengers but only for the stock price of the shareholder.

I have not found any address or instructions on where to send the document (and any others) to get this into the AA system. Any ideas? The 2nd issue is about the complaint / concern with the far less than acceptable overnight accommodation in Philadelphia. The hotel in question is the Wyndham Garden Hotel. This is how AA takes care of international flyers? I have to believe than no customer support executives have stayed at this hotel.

Last Christmas, I was back in the United States visiting family and friends. This was when COVID was absolutely rampant in the U.S. and ended up getting COVID while there and was very, very sick from it. At that time, to get into Thailand, you needed a negative PCR COVID test, which I didn’t have, for my original flight to get back to Thailand. I ended up having to change my flight twice because of all of this and missed more than a week of school because of it. It was extremely stressful, especially while being so, so sick from COVID like I was. The customer service I received when I needed to rebook my flight multiple times was phenomenal. That was all such a stressful situation, and dealing with American to rebook my flight could’ve been one more area of stress, but it wasn’t. And I was so, so thankful. I called later than I was supposed to one of the times because I was driving to the airport to see if maybe I would get my COVID test back in time while driving to the airport to make my flight. I didn’t get the test back in time but didn’t call right away to change my flight because I had a pounding headache that was turning into a migraine and was extremely exhausted. When I called a few hours later, the woman I spoke to was incredibly helpful and understanding and still allowed me to rebook my flight without having to pay for a new one. She didn’t give me a hard time or make me wait a long time. It’s almost a year later, and I still remember her kindness and am still so thankful for her and how she helped me in the midst of a really stressful, really hard situation. I felt like she really valued customers as people and understood how stressful air travel was at that time; she wasn’t just going by policies. She may have technically been “breaking the policy,” but she made me want to be a loyal customer to American. With all of my flights since, when American has been an option, I’ve chosen American almost every time. She made me feel valued and seen as a person. So if anyone from American reads these reviews, I want you to know showing understanding and care to your customers, like this woman did to me, is how you gain loyal customers.

Firstly, carry on. My assigned grouping prevented me from boarding until 90% of passengers were already on the plane. When I could finally board, AA staff told that there was no space in the cabin for any more carry on items and that my single item (which met their carry on requirements) would have to be checked in. I replied that this was the first leg of a long journey to Australia and I needed access to my carry on. They literally said there was nothing they could do about that and that I would be bumped from the flight if I refused to check it in. They also said the door was closing soon so I had to decide immediately. I feel that this created an element of duress that was at a minimum unethical. I also think that their attitude to customers is appalling considering that these situation are 100% AA’s fault - their carry on requirements don’t align with the capacity of their own aircraft. When I finally received my suitcase back from them in Sydney, I found that they had somehow completely destroyed it (see attached photo).

We were attempting to get to our honeymoon destination in Jamaica. We boarded the flight around 12:10 PM with an expected take off at 12:56 PM. There was light rain that turned into thunderstorms for the first hour of us waiting to take off, delaying our flight. After the first hour it went back to light rain and we noticed several airplanes starting to take off on the runway. After waiting for another hour with minimal updates from the pilot, we were instructed to exit the aircraft. We did as we were told and went to the gate to wait for further instructions. We were informed after about 45 mins minutes that another pilot will be taking over and we were able to re-board the aircraft. The time at re-boarding was approximately 4:30. After another hour of waiting on the now second pilot to take us to our destination, the plane suddenly turned around on the ramp when we were very close to take-off. The plane was taken back to the terminal and all of us passengers were waiting to hear what the delay was this time. Unfortunately for us, there was little communication as to why we could not depart for our destination now 5 hours after our SCHEDULED departure time. I would like to say there was a “vague” explanation but I simply cannot. Even their pilot could not explain why he was not allowed to take us where we paid good money to be. It was at this time we were instructed to de-board the plane a SECOND time. After some talk amongst the flight crew and I suppose them communicating with their outside resources, they informed us of a THIRD pilot who would be boarding and be responsible for taking us to our destination. We FINALLY were able to depart at exactly 7:06PM. We had been on that plane for 7 hours today, just sitting and waiting and left in the dark. The flight crew kindly passed around cookies and one cup of water during our first delay around approximately 2:30. When asked to de-board there was no time for any passengers to stop and eat because we were trying to stay close to be informed on the situation only to re-board and wait an additional 3 hours. There were several small children on this flight as well. AA should be extremely disappointed in how this situation was handled. It was unprofessional and cruel to leave us waiting and waste our time. My husband and I missed our first day at our expensive resort on our first day of our honeymoon. They left children and other passengers crying and hungry. Shame on them. I am not one to leave a bad review or even write an email to this extent (especially on my honeymoon) but given the situation it is much deserved. We tried on our honeymoon to call and get compensation and all we received were two $50 trip vouchers. We will NEVER fly AA again and neither should you.

We flew American Airlines both ways. We had a total of 18 flights there and back. Everything was good until we went to board in Miami. Before we even boarded the gate attendant was talking to a drunk guy saying “now we aren’t going to have anymore problems with you are we?” And the gate attendant held out his hand for the drunk guy to shake it and the drunk guy wouldn’t shake it. They still let the drunk guy board the plane. As we are in position to take off the flight attendant came over the PA telling him to sit down we are taking off. He did sit down but they still had several problems with him. So when we get 1 hour out from Miami they turn the plane around, without saying anything to us until we are just outside Miami. Than when we landed we landed to hard and broke the landing gear. We hit HARD. Security came and got the drunk guy off the plane and we are told that we just had to refuel than we would take off. After 1/2 hour they said that we had to take our stuff and get off the plane. We waiting in the airport for over 2 hrs and there where mothers with multiple babies and they would not get those women their strollers so they had to hold their babies the whole time and there was 1 lady with 4 babies under 6 months. Than after 3 hours they tell us they are rescheduling our flight for the next day and we couldn’t get our luggage. So hopefully you packed some clothes in your carry on, which we had. We finally got in our hotel room at 3am. We had not had anything to eat since our last flight at like 4pm. We where starving and nothing was open. The next day we did take off around 1pm but we ended up missing a whole day of our trip. It messed up our hotel, rental car. We did file a complaint with AA. They offered My husband $50 total for our inconvenience. My husband emailed them back and said he was insulted. So they ended up giving us $175 per person of AA credit.

Sharon was wonderful at helping me sort out how to fly standby on an earlier flight. She helped Kim learn how to properly tag a checked bag when the traveler is on Standby. Instead of brushing me aside they were capable, calm, smiling, and gracious to me and to other travelers in line. Everything went smoothly as grace. So many other people greeted me with friendly smiles, good eye contact, patience and kindness (when I bugged them to ask if I’d made the cut to Standby seat).

I’ve been very disappointed. There was a 4-hour delay on my flight out of BWI to DFW. I needed to return home early for a family matter, so I spent the afternoon before my return flight looking for an earlier flight. They had a couple, but the up charges were $500+ and $900+. There were several other (non direct) flights that would get me as close as DC in time, but they wanted $250 for those. I was also told that I could not get a refund if I were to find a flight with another airline, so I decided to just stick with my original American reservation. I wasn’t able to check in online for some reason—the counter person told me that it was a computer glitch. They had trouble checking me in—a person in training tried initially and got confused. A second employee tried and was also confused. A third employee at the counter made some calls and finally got it worked out. They also told me at that time that my flight back to BWI was delayed an hour and a half. It may be rare, but I’ve never experienced a delay… until now…a 4 hour delay going to Dallas, and an hour and a half delay returning. Delayed coming and going! Wow.

Started our trip on September 1 to a cancelled flight due to weather despite all other airlines flying into the same location. They rebooked us for the following day at 10 pm which would cause us to miss our connection in Lima to Cusco and cause a domino effect of missed booked tours etc, not to mention paid for hotels we didn't use and couldn't get reimbursed for. Eventually they did rebook our original flight on Alaska airlines which flew into Dallas on time. Our connection to Lima, however, was delayed. When we finally boarded, we sat on the aircraft for 1.5 hours waiting for a copilot to show before the flight was pushed back 3 hours due to a curfew in Lima. We had to get off the plane and wait only to find out an hour later the flight was delayed until the following morning. There was a 200 person line at the customer service desk with 2 people working so we didn't even bother to try for a hotel or food voucher. The next morning flight got delayed an additional hour, but we finally made it to Lima. Our trip has now ended and we were supposed to be on a morning flight September 11 at 0800 to Dallas, but the flight was delayed 5 times inside of 15 minutes and eventually rescheduled 24 hours after the inital departure time this time due to mechanical issues. The story we got was the issue couldn't be fixed and they were bringing another plane in. Someone else we spoke to said there was a part they couldn't get and didn't know when it would arrive so who knows what the real answer is. No one on the phone for customer service could help us. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours and the best they could offer was a 30 hour travel time with 2 layovers in the opposite direction of where we needed to go only to arrive at the same time as we would if we waited until the next day (today). Just as we were about to leave for the airport this morning 5 texts came in stating the flight was delayed multiple different times. We called customer service who reassured us the flight was still happening and only delayed 20 mins. We got to the airport today and waited in line for 3 hours before receiving a text saying the flight had been canceled, but another scheduled flight to Dallas left on time. Staff directing people to the counter lines refused to give any information and were dismissive of people's concerns. When we got to the ticket counter, we were told all other flight options were already booked and the best they could do was give us a flight on a different carrier at 0100 tomorrow (40 hours after our originally scheduled flight) with an additional 8 hour layover at LAX. They finally booked us with a different carrier and hopefully we will make it home 2 days late. They told us before they weren't obligated to rebook us with any other carrier if the delay was 24 hours or less and that they don't have any other partner airlines they can book with, yet miraculously after the 24 hour mark they can and do book us with someone else. Half of our trip time has been spent traveling and we have lost wages at work, cost of extra hotels, and food. We had a family member with a medical emergency at the end of our trip and were unable to make it home in time before they passed away.

I told her that’s not possible look at my ticket confirmation I even spoke to a representative to check on the status and said it was fine. I was able to talk to someone online and get to JFK, NYC. that same afternoon when I got to NY at 6 pm they told me they could only put me in the 8 am flight for next day & asked them if they could put me in a hotel nearby or the lounge area for causing me all these trouble - I have to sit on a chair for 12 hours. And the counter guy look at me in the eyes and said we are not going to do anything about it, make a complaint or call if you want but we cannot help you!

We had no idea how much trouble we would be by trusting a company that seemed just about right at first glance. We are a group of 6 people (3 couples), average ages between 60-70, semi-retired (still working since social security income doesn´t even cover the average expenses) and self-employed. We had been planning this trip for several months since all of us had to close our schedules, save money and make it work according to our budgets. With all the inflation, recession it was already a struggle to make it work for us all. Everything started with our flight from Nashville to Miami being cancelled only 10 hours prior. We depended 100% on that flight to take an International flight to Samana (Dominican Republic) after only 4h layover. American Airlines is the only airline with that destination available and has only 1 flight/week to that location, so losing that flight would literally ruin the whole vacation. Our Resort was already reserved/paid for and could not be cancelled, so a no-show would cost us cancellation fee money as well. Immediately when we were notified that our flight was cancelled we called American Airlines Customer Service, it took nothing less than 1.5h to finally reach a representative and to be honest, she was not helpful at all. One more hour waiting and we finally could talk to a supervisor. She could not rebook us with American Airlines or any other partner so we decided to start searching flights from Atlanta (checking all other airlines) to Miami and ask the supervisor to change our coming back flight (final destination in Atlanta instead of Nashville so we could leave our car there and have a car to drive back home). Two hours later we could get our coming back flights changed with final destination in Atlanta but at that point there were no more flights available from Atlanta to Miami. Back to square one we decided to get us a flight straight to Punta Cana and forget the AA flight to Samana since would be impossible to get there in time even if we decided to drive. I found a flight from Atlanta to Punta Cana (5.5h drive from our Resort) and all of us could get a seat (we purchased from different websites all at once so nobody would be left behind). This flight cost each couple the average amount of $938. We loaded our Van and drove to Atlanta right away ($165.00 paid in gas). I also had to get a parking space for 7 days which cost us total $87.55. We finally flew to Punta Cana and got a 5.5h transfer to Samana, which also cost us the amount of $412.05. After this huge adventure we could make it there 24h later and it was the most stressful and frustrating hours in our lives. But the mistakes kept happening. When we got to El Catey Samana Airport, one of the check-in employees (still being trained) made a mistake: he forgot to print the tickets for the flight from Miami to Atlanta for 2 of us (Mr. Dannie Glover and Mrs. Hope Glover), later on in Miami the lady at the gate was extremely rude and unprofessional (her name is Valentina by the way). Flight to Atlanta was delayed 2 hours and she sent us to Gate D37 (Customer Service) just 5 min before boarding.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

With a nearly full plane, we were stranded on the tarmac for over an hour because of a “last minute change” with the pilot, leaving us without a captain for the trip. The issue was eventually remedied by convincing an inbound pilot to fly our trip immediately following his own. This caused a significant number of passengers to miss connecting flights in Charlotte. I had a two hour layover before my last leg to Raleigh Durham International. Yet again, waiting at the gate for over an hour because the plane was late for arrival. The announcement for the delay came well after the plane was initially supposed to start boarding and customers were simply kept in the dark. Upon my return flight home back to Dallas, I was lucky enough to get a direct flight. And for a third time, the plane is delayed for “minor maintenance issues” but the announcement yet again came 20 mins after the flight was staged to board. All in all, I was an hour and a half late for return to my destination. I am a very understanding person and realize that unforeseen circumstances occasionally arise which may cause a delay to travel plans. I expect these things to happen and plan accordingly. However, these occurrences should be rare. A 20% delay rating is completely unacceptable for a major airline.

He tried a couple of time, but then gave up. We had over 60 people waiting for bags. And after 2 hours only 3 bags came down the belt. Very bad Management. Have to wait in queue to talk to Baggage service 3 times 1:43, 2:08, and I'm still waiting on the line for 1h 17m minutes to find out where my bags is. To all you wives, I want to thank you for your support as she couldn't sleep knowing I was on the road all night and kept me up. She decided to join the festivities and is calling on my behalf as well now. I even have enough time to finish this review.

Flight to Miami was fine, apart from the ludicrous check in system that took about an hour longer than it needed to. Once we got into Miami we found our next flight been delayed about an hour. No worries, even multiple hour delays are expected sometimes, I can deal with that. But from there it got ridiculous. Boarded the plane in Miami, sat on the tarmac for two hours with no refreshments while the cabin crew made up excuses. First it was technical issues, then a shortage of crew members, then finally no pilot. We were asked to exit the plane but assured it would be a short delay. Once we were off the plane they cancelled the flight and told us to get into line for rebooking. The rebooking line took 9 HOURS for us, but as more and more flights were cancelled, people were standing in line for up to 15 hours! When we finally reached the front of the queue we were told that the flight was cancelled due to weather, despite being told that there was no captain, and witnessing a multitude of other flights taking off and landing during this 'weather'. Because of this blatant lie of a cancellation reason we were entitled to nothing but a seat on the next flight out (for us 24 hours later). We wanted to fly back to Nashville that night with a refund so we could rebook with a competent airline, but we told ‘you can’t because it was cancelled due to weather’. No hotel vouchers, no food vouchers and even the free water bottles and single cookies had run out 5 hours prior. Not even an apology. There was a group behind us flying somewhere else that would miss a funeral if they couldn't leave the following morning and were just told 'too bad'. We were forced to sleep on the filthy floor of Miami Airport in 20 degrees C (68 F) aircon all night. Finally we made it to Quito where of course I discovered that they had lost my backpack. It has now been two days with no updates and I am stuck in 5 degrees C (41 F) weather with nothing but a thin jumper and shorts, on my honeymoon. This airline actively hates it's customers and will never lift a finger to help you, despite receiving billions of your taxes in bailouts over covid.

We had to wait so long at the rebooking that by the time we got to shuttle station, the shuttle was no longer running and had to take a cab for $40. The saga continued on the way home with the first delay being 30 minutes for our flight which might have enabled us to make our connection but alas, that delay turned to an hour at which time it was announced that our plane was still in Cuba.

American Airlines was a nightmare. As we landed in Philadelphia, our flight to Phoenix was cancelled. We stood in line for hours to re-check in our luggage after custom and to find out if there were other flights. We were treated by the American Airlines staff as packages. The lady that did my check in in Philadelphia had me pay again my extra bag saying that it was overweight. I had already paid the extra bag in Venice. She told me that I was lucky she did not charge me more. My son said that a bag doesn’t just gain weight on a flight, and it all seemed very suspicious. She told him that she did not talk to children. My son is 18 and in college. Her attitude was horrible. I ended up having to pay another $100. She disrespected me and many other passengers. We were placed on a flight for Las Vegas, but after 2 hours on the plane, they had us all get off the plane. The reason: crowded air traffic and no pilots available. We had to wait 3 hours in a long line to find out what was next. Midnight approached. Only 3 people were working with hundreds of passengers in line. Some had small children. One had a very tiny baby. Some had pets. Some were elderly people who were struggling and tired. Some did not speak English and did not understand what was happening. All while one of their staff members was laughing out loud while telling us that none of us was gonna get on any flight until Friday. Her attitude was inhuman. Passengers pay her pay check, and she was treating them like garbage, laughing at them. People were crying and in emotional distress. It was heart breaking. Around 1:00 am, we finally got boarding passes for other flights. However, we had to pay our own Uber and hotel because the flights were the day after and no vouchers were given to us. At 1:30 am, the American Airlines staff stopped serving those passengers that were left in the long line and shut down the assistance. Those people were left hanging until the day after. Some won’t reach their destinations until Saturday night. This is unacceptable. My son and I got extremely sick. I won’t go into detail, but all of this affected other plans and a work trip I had coming up on Sunday. Can’t travel if you are sick, and American Airlines is responsible for every bit of it.

I am a platinum frequent flier and have flown on over 15 different airlines. Internationally - they are hands down the worst. After making changes to my itinerary due to “schedule changes” that had not actually occurred (I confirmed by searching the flight status of the flights I was originally booked on, and ending up on some of those flights), they advised me that a number of flights in my itinerary were now full and I could not be rebooked. After solving this myself with the codeshare airlines they had booked me on, their advice turned out to be completely wrong and I ended up on my originally booked flights - though they continued to claim my tickets were cancelled. They then tried to cancel them again when it was confirmed I was still booked on the flights. No reason, no communication, just simply poor systems, incompetent staff and bad customer service. Once I was on my trip, they failed to issue tickets for two legs, which resulted in me spending over 6 hours on hold with their call centre, to again receive no assistance in resolving the issue. Staff from British Airways ended up helping me resolve the problem on both occasions. Their customer service and ticketing are completely and utterly incompetent and their systems are fundamentally flawed. Towards the end of my trip, they cancelled a leg of my return journey with no information as to why and no offer to re-book or resolve the issue, which resulted in me having to pay an additional $1000 to book a flight on another airline to make my connection from the US to Australia. I’m now struggling to get any kind of refund or flight credit for the flight they cancelled. On top of their administrative incompetence, their inflight service was appalling. Revolting food, rude cabin crew, filthy aircraft and shocking ground service. Their entertainment system was bad (at best) and they charge top dollar for inflight wifi that doesn’t even work. Honestly, I am extremely easy going, and always incredibly friendly to airline staff - there are just zero redeeming features for this company and I didn’t come across a single member of staff who seemed to know what they were doing or how to resolve issues their company had created.

But turns out we weren’t .. we were on the 8pm flight. They put us in a hotel which was kind of helpful. We decided to go with another airline to get home the next morning. When I went to the ticket counter to tell them to cancel our flight she informed us she could get us on standby at 9:30, or regular booking at 11:30. Both have now been delayed. They’ve already told me they don’t know where my bag is and will call us when it arrives in SLC. I called to express my frustration with the airline and see what was going on, and why so many problems. The manager didn’t care at all. She didn’t even say sorry for the inconvenience. She was completely monotone and said they would not do anything to compensate me since I still took the flight. I usually don’t write reviews, or complain about employees, this is only the 2nd review/complaint I’ve ever written. But I felt it necessary because of the horrendous experience we have had. I want to warn others about this airline and save them from having the experience we’ve had. Needless to say we are delusional and exhausted from the run around, changing of gates, times etc. We could have driven home faster, and I’m fully regretting not doing that at this point. Save your time, money and sanity and do not book with AA. And btw, we had three friends fly out of Kentucky with AA this weekend and they all had similar experiences. Two of them had to drive to another airport and pay $1,000 each because of the runaround AA puts their customers through.

Both times, nothing but horrible. This last time was the worse experience I have had ever traveling. Was flying out from Norfolk Airport traveling to Albuquerque. Flight was scheduled for 5:15pm, I received a text around 2:30ish that my flight from Norfolk to Dallas was cancelled. Waiting in line at the service desk, the AA worker (nicest worker and best encounter all day) told me to hop on this flight that was going to Charlotte then to get on one from there to Dallas. Was worried, I thought everything was good. We land in charlotte, I had about 20 min to get to the connecting and ended up being delayed 45min. I wasn’t worried because I had a 5hr layover in Dallas. Land in Dallas and I decided to sit at the bar for the 5hrs to have dinner and some drinks to waste time. We are supposed to board at 10:50pm to go to ABQ. Everyone is lined up at the gate ready to board and 3min before boarding. (Not even exaggerating. Literally 3 min before boarding) the flight gets cancelled. We’re waiting in line at the service desk. Everyone is going crazy. I finally get up to the desk, this was the last flight of the night. Next option was to stand on stand by for the 4 different flights that were all sold out to Albuquerque tomorrow. (This was the option for everyone on that full flight. You think stand by was going to happen for everyone? NO.) so I ask the worker to put me on standby or what my options were to get home sooner. He tells me the next flight he could get me an actual seat on would be for Monday. That is Two days stuck in Dallas. I have work on Monday, this was not an option for me. I asked him about cancelling my flight and what AA would cover if I have to just get a rental car and drive. He said “because of the circumstances, AA could refund you up to $200 for your rental alone.” I said “perfect. Cancel my flight now and I will book a rental for tomorrow morning.” I then asked him “what about a hotel, are you guys going to pay to put me in a hotel tonight?” He said “AA will be sending you a link for some hotel choices to book and be covered under them.” I received the link, they gave 3 hotel options. All of these hotels were sold out before even getting the link. I showed him and he said “pick a hotel and AA will reimburse you $125 for a hotel, just save all of your receipts and send everything in. I booked the hotel, he gave me vouchers for the taxi. Everything is fine. Next day, rental car cost me $444 ($200 of it being refunded at time of delivery) not including gas. I finally get home after driving 10 hours the next day. Submit all my receipts and the issue and AA responds a week later “we can only give you a refund for the amount that the connecting flight to your destination was.” $57 it was. Then I replied “no, this work told me everything would be reimbursed, $125 credit in hotel and my rental would be taken care of. All three of my flights that day had issues, I was stuck in Dallas, and you guys wanted to keep me there 2 extra days stranded” they respond “my apologies I can give you a check for $100 for the hotel. And $100 in flight credit only. The guy that told you about the rental was wrong.” American is the worst airlines, I have never had some many issues with an airline and now I’m out of $300 that will not be refunded because the crew members didn’t want to “show up”.

They sent us to the rebooking counter, which had a two hour wait to be helped.

We requested compensation and we’re not offered any. Instead they directed us to email customer service (which we did and received an automated response for a 7-10 business day or longer response during peak travel times). The gate “manager” offered us two $12 meal vouchers for the ADDITIONAL DAY of travel - one of which did not work when we went to use it. Finally, we inquired about a hotel for the evening, but they were “sold out” because we (once again) “waited too long.” We were offered to book our own room and receive a $150 reimbursement - good luck finding a hotel room in Miami at 1am on a Friday for that price! My husband and I were able to rebook our flights - but all the nonstop were unavailable (which was what we originally booked to get home to our two children - 2.5 and 8months) - so they gave us a ticket which included a 7 hour layover.

I had to run for my flight every single flight. The first time i wasn't prepared to be a track star and I made it to the gate 10 minutes before departure but the gate was closed. There was no one at the gate to help me find a desk for support. I found the desk for support and they mocked me like i was responsible for the last minute gate change.  WIFI was $13 per hour or $17 per flight, no option to purchase a day pass and they had a count down timer they literally gave me 1 hour, despite the plane not having signal for 9 minutes. All these terms and conditions on the website so i doubt i can request a refund but a more practical thing to do would be to either give a person an extra 15 minutes or give a day pass. Especially when you don't offer direct flights, so it's like you automatically charging $26 - 34 per day for bad service.  I lost my headset at DFW, I go to the lost and found, the lady didn't even acknowledge A customer at her desk. (airport had 2 lost and found areas) I finally got her attention, explained I lost my headset, she asked when, I told her this morning she didn't have it OK, i asked if she could call the other lost and found perhaps someone turned it in at E terminal. She said no in the most unapologetic way have me a paper with the website and told me that all she could do. i told her i was aware of the website but the website also had the Terminal listed as a location for LOST AND FOUND.  Also forced me to check my bag, I specifically bring a 1 gallon bag with 20 different travel sized bottles like the airport request because going to claim bag area is time consuming, but they forced me to check my bag.

      "I usually fly Singapore Airlines internationally, since 10 years I am a Krisflyer Gold member. The recent pricing and service changes, show the results of bailed out airlines believing ethical standards don't apply to them anymore. Unbelievably toxic SIA service for business customers. Bear in mind if you fly for business and may have changes you will need 3 days and potentially dozens of phone calls and sessions to even rebook flexi tickets which then costs north of 1000$. This particular flight was booked via our company travel agent, a large international agent. Leaving aside the drop in service quality over years, from discontinuing warm towels to not offering snacks anymore during the flight, what has really infuriated me with SIA are the change policies. On this flight, despite having the highest premium economy booking class (T) with a full flexi ticket, a simple change in flight date cost me >1000$ extra is unexplained fees: In addition to the change in ticket price, which makes no sense on the highest booking class, a rebooking fee, a no show fee , a digital processing fee and the worst 250$ of \"offline\" fee because I used an agent, not their website. While my agent was helpful, SIA straight out refused to talk to them. It took 3 full days and 15 chat sessions to actually get the ticket rebooked for a simple day change on the exact same flight, SIA let them wait 30min per session, as they are only available to agents during Singapore business hours - and if they are closes they simply hang up.\n",

SQ could not have cared less about re-booking the flight proactively so that I would not miss my MLE connection in SIN. I had to call their incompetent customer service in Singapore and fight with them for 2 hours on the phone so that my flight was eventually rebooked via MUC - FOn the re-booked leg they managed to lose my bag in MUC. I did trace the bag with an Apple air tag and it was delivered to SIN the next day. Rather than getting the bag on the next flight to MLE, SQ kept it in SIN for another two days before sending it on to MLE From my experience, SQ is ok as it comes to cabin service (whilst you can see their cost saving actions as well with no more amenity kits in C, cheap wines etc.). However, as it comes to customer service, SQ is absolutely below any standard I have ever seen. In fact they could not care less about their customer - and I am speaking of business class.\n",

Due to a cancellation by another airline, I needed to modify the departure on my full fare, refundable ticket. I completed the customer assistance form on their website to request the rebooking, and tried repeatedly over an 8 hour period to reach their customer service number in the US. It was impossible to get past the recording and reach an agent over the phone. It was also not possible to make this change myself online. Upon arriving at Changi, I discovered that instead of changing my outbound flight as requested, Singapore Airlines cancelled my entire ticket. When I tried to rebook the flight, there was not a single open seat for the return over a two day period (Easter weekend). Agents at Changi were apologetic and tried to help, but with no seats available, there was little they could do. I have never before been unable to reach an airline representative, and this has certainly not been the case when I have tried multiple channels over an 8 hour time period. I am appalled by the lack of basic customer service extended to a passenger holding a Y fare ticket and Star Alliance Gold status. I would encourage any US-based traveler to avoid Singapore Airlines at all costs until they can bring their customer service up to a minimum level. I will not be flying Singapore Airlines again.\n"

      "That was it. SQ could not have cared less about re-booking the flight proactively so that I would not miss my MLE connection in SIN. I had to call their incompetent customer service in Singapore and fight with them for 2 hours on the phone so that my flight was eventually rebooked via MUC - FOn the re-booked leg they managed to lose my bag in MUC. I did trace the bag with an Apple air tag and it was delivered to SIN the next day. Rather than getting the bag on the next flight to MLE, SQ kept it in SIN for another two days before sending it on to MLE From my experience, SQ is ok as it comes to cabin service (whilst you can see their cost saving actions as well with no more amenity kits in C, cheap wines etc.). However, as it comes to customer service, SQ is absolutely below any standard I have ever seen. In fact they could not care less about their customer - and I am speaking of business class.\n",
      "This particular flight was booked via our company travel agent, a large international agent. Leaving aside the drop in service quality over years, from discontinuing warm towels to not offering snacks anymore during the flight, what has really infuriated me with SIA are the change policies. On this flight, despite having the highest premium economy booking class (T) with a full flexi ticket, a simple change in flight date cost me >1000$ extra is unexplained fees: In addition to the change in ticket price, which makes no sense on the highest booking class, a rebooking fee, a no show fee , a digital processing fee and the worst 250$ of \"offline\" fee because I used an agent, not their website. While my agent was helpful, SIA straight out refused to talk to them. It took 3 full days and 15 chat sessions to actually get the ticket rebooked for a simple day change on the exact same flight, SIA let them wait 30min per session, as they are only available to agents during Singapore business hours - and if they are closes they simply hang up.\n",
