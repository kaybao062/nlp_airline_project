Therefore, there are two sectors and each sector has a Most Significant Operating Carrier. From Taipei to Bangkok, EVA Air is the Most Significant Operating Carrier and the baggage policies of EVA Air will apply to this sector. From Bangkok to Frankfurt, Carrier XX is the Most Significant Operating Carrier as it operates the geographically longer stretch from Bangkok to Frankfurt. The baggage policy of Carrier XX will apply to the entire sector from Bangkok to Copenhagen.</p><p>Example 2: Sydney-{BB}-Brisbane(non-stopover)-{CC}-Taipei((non-stopover)-{BR}-Heathrow</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">In this example, there is one Most Significant Operating Carrier because there are no stopovers on the journey. EVA Air is the Most Significant Operating Carrier as it is operating the geographically longer stretch from Taipei to London. Therefore, the baggage policies of EVA Air will apply from Sydney to London.</p><p>According to the regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation, when the departure or destination of a passenger's ticket itinerary is within the United States, the first carrier on the ticket determines its free baggage allowance and related charges (including code-share flights). For example, if a passenger’s itinerary is Houston-Los Angeles-Taipei-Los Angeles-Houston, the first segment takes a United Airlines flight, and the latter segment takes an EVA Air flight, the whole journey must follow the United Airlines baggage policy, including the return journey.&nbsp;</p><p>The Canadian Transport Agency also has similar regulations for the departure or destination of passenger ticket itineraries that are located in Canada. You can contact your travel agency, check our interline partner’s website, or contact EVA Air ticketing offices to check the relevant checked baggage regulations.</p><p><strong>Baggage Through-Tagging Restrictions</strong></p><p>If your itinerary includes more than one flight on EVA/UNI Air and/or one of our interline partners in one ticket, we will check your bags to the final destination on your ticket as long as there are less than 12 hours between flights. If you will stay at the connecting point for more than 12 hours, you will need to claim and re-check your baggage. Additional baggage fees may apply.</p><p>Because of government regulations or other restrictions (e.g. terminal change), your baggage may not be interlined to interior points in certain countries and checked only to the gateway of that country.&nbsp; You must claim your baggage at the gateway city, clear it through customs, and arrange to transfer it to the connecting carrier.</p></div>
